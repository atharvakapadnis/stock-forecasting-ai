# Stock Market Forecasting using AI

## 📌 About
This project explores **stock market forecasting** using various **machine learning, deep learning, and time series forecasting techniques**. The goal is to experiment with different forecasting methodologies and evaluate their performance in predicting stock prices.

The project includes:
- **Baseline models** (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- **Classical time series forecasting** (ARIMA, VAR)
- **Deep learning models** (LSTM, GRU, Transformers)
- **Hybrid models** (ARIMA + LSTM, XGBoost + LSTM, CNN + LSTM)
- **Advanced AI techniques** (Graph Neural Networks, AutoML, Diffusion Models)

🔗 **Live Demo**: [Stock Sentinel](https://stock-sentinel.streamlit.app/)
